A complaint management system in Python typically involves a program that allows users to submit complaints, tracks their status, and facilitates resolution. It involves functionalities such as complaint submission, categorization, assignment to relevant personnel, status updates, and closure tracking. Python, with its flexibility and diverse libraries, can be used to create a user-friendly interface, manage data storage, and automate workflows within the system for efficient complaint resolution.
